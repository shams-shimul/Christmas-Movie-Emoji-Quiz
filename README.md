# Christmas Movie Emoji Quiz 🎄🎬🌟

**JavaScriptomas 2024 challenge from Scrimba, Day 4.**

This fun and stimulating game challenges players to guess the title of popular Christmas movies using only emoji clues! Doesn't it sound super amusing? Hop in with 🍿 to test your holiday movie knowledge!

## How to Play

1. The app will present you with a set of emojis that correlate to the core theme of a Christmas movie.

2. You will have 3 guesses to correctly identify the movie.

3. If you guess correctly, or run out of guessing attempts, you'll be given a new set of clues.

## Features

-  **Random Selection:** Emoji clues are selected at random for each round, keeping the game unpredictable and exciting.

-  **No Repeats:** Each movie will only be used once per session, ensuring no repetition until all films from the preloaded dataset have been guessed.

-  **Feedback Messages:** Players receive immediate feedback on their guesses, adding to the thrill.

-  **Smooth Transition:** A brief pause between rounds ensures a seamless gaming experience.

Let the guessing begin and have a jolly good time. 🎬🌟
